# XForce Serverless (Express + TypeScript)

This project is a small Express microservice written in TypeScript and ready to deploy as a Vercel Serverless Function.

It receives a grammar topic in the request body and calls the Gemini API to generate an English grammar explanation.

## Features

- Express API running on Vercel Serverless
- TypeScript setup
- Gemini 1.5 Flash integration
- Returns a plain text response (HTML string)

## API

### POST /api/grammar

**Request body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "level": "B1",
  "concept": "Present Perfect",
  "description": "Actions started in the past and connected to now",
  "example": "I have lived here for five years."
}
```

**Required fields:**

- `level`
- `concept`
- `description`
- `example`

**Response:**

- Content-Type: `text/plain`
- Body: a string that contains semantic HTML with Tailwind classes (generated by Gemini)

## Environment variables

Set this variable in your environment (local) and in Vercel (production):

There is also an example file: `.env.example`.

## Run locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create your `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Start in dev mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then call:

- `POST http://localhost:3000/api/grammar`

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Import the project in Vercel.
3. Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` in Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables.
4. Deploy.

The entry point for Vercel is `api/index.ts`, and routing is configured in `vercel.json`.
